In-game, BINMAT serves as a "last line of defence" for your system, being encountered after all locks on your system have been solved.

Unlike locks, BINMAT is a form of active defence, requiring some form of participation from the defending user to be effective.

The game has 2 teams, attackers and defenders. If the attackers win, the defending system is breached. If defenders win, it is not.

The rules for BINMAT can be found [here](https://github.com/comcode-org/binmat_rules).

A way to play BINMAT recreationally is [binm.at](https://binm.at/).
