## When does a game start?

A game of BINMAT begins once an attacking player solves all locks on a system, and both players have the nessecary ante.

When the above conditions are met, the ante is sent from the defender to trust, and then the attacker to trust, and a game of BINMAT starts between the attacker and defender.

If the defender cannot pay the ante, no game is started, and their system is breached.

If the attacker cannot pay the ante, they do not join the created game.

Do note that an attacker cannot start a game against a system of a higher tier.

## The ante/pot

The ante needed for BINMAT is based on the tier of the defending system.

| Tier | BINMAT Ante |
| :--: | :---------: |
|  0   |     N/A     |
|  1   |  ((8MGC))   |
|  2   | ((512MGC))  |
|  3   |  ((8BGC))   |
|  4   |  ((32BGC))  |
