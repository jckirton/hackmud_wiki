Flush shell contents to shell.txt.

## Usage

((%Cflush%))

Then, navigate to hackmud config directory.

> Run ((%C#dir%)) and go two folders up. Or navigate to:
>
> > Windows - `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\hackmud`\
> > macOS - `~/.config/hackmud`\

In that folder should be a file called `shell.txt`, which will contain the flushed text.
