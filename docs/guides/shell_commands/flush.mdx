Flush shell contents to shell.txt.

## Usage

((%Cflush%))

Then, navigate to hackmud config directory.

> Try using running ((%C#dir%)) and going two folders up. Or navigating to:
> > Windows - `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\hackmud`\
> > macOS - `~/.config/hackmud`\
> > Linux - Either `~/.config/hackmud` or the game folder.

In that folder should be a file called `shell.txt`, which will contain the flushed text.
